## ab1 to JSON file conversion

### This is currently work in progress and not complete.  At present the javascript can extract base and quality data from certain versions of Applied Biosystems ab1 files.  A demo index.html page is given as an example that will also extract trace data and display it as a chromatogram.  A compatible ab1 file named example.ab1 is included in the repository to test drive the app.
